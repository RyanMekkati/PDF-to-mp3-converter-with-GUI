# PDF-to-mp3-converter-with-GUI

A python code that converts a pdf to an mp3 file that is readable through a user interface. That graphical interface was made from tinter and we use a few libraries for technical usage like converting pdfs to text. I thought about studying from anywhere and the best way I thought of by listening. Unfortunately, many of the apps that exist online require you to pay for useless AI voices which were just gimmicks in my opinion. This is the event that lead me to this little project.
